    "The company CEO asked you very specific questions:  \n",
    "--What are the top 3 and the bottom 3 states in terms of number of users?  \n",
    "--What are the top 3 and the bottom 3 states in terms of user engagement? You can choose how to mathematically define user engagement. What the CEO cares about here is in which states users are using the product a lot/very little.  \n",
    "--The CEO wants to send a gift to the first user who signed-up for each state. That is, the first user who signed-up from California, from Oregon, etc. Can you give him a list of those users?  \n",
    "--Build a function that takes as an input any of the songs in the data and returns the most likely song to be listened next. That is, if, for instance, a user is currently listening to \"Eight Days A Week\", which song has the highest probability of being played right after it by the same user? This is going to be v1 of a song recommendation model.  \n",
    "--How would you set up a test to check whether your model works well and is improving engagement?\n",

    "--song_played : the song that was listened  \n",

    "Shown above, we have a list of the number of unique users per state. New York, California, and Texas are the top three and are far ahead of other staes in terms of unique users. At the bottom, nine states are tied with one user each: ND, KS, IA, RI, NE, ID, CT, NM, and AZ. We can see that the number of users roughly correlates to state population, as our top three states are three of the most populated, and the bottom states tend to be less populated. We will need to consider how to correct for this correlation with population when defining user engagement.\n",

    "The CEO wants to know which states have users that are using the product a lot or a little. As discussed above, more populous states have more users, so we must account for this by using some sort of per-user metric rather than looking at total plays. The most straightforward metric is average plays per user, which captures how active each user is and accounts for variance in users per state.\n",

    "To find average plays per user in each state, we will take the same pivot table as above - which shows unique users per state - and calculate it again while removing the count \"unique\" designation so that we end up with total plays (rows) in each state. Then we can simply divide the second series by the first to get an average for each state."

To do this, we will split the dataframe by user, sort from oldest to most recent play, and add a column containing the next song played for each song (except the last, since there is no next song). We will also include the previous two songs for possible use in later predictive modeling, but must be aware that each additional lag will decrease the amount of usable data since it will require excluding the first few observations that do not have enough previous songs."

So, any rate above this can be considered an improvement. \n",

Let's try another type of classifier that can perform well in a problem with a large number of classes - the k-nearest neighbors model.

    "Sure enough, AdaBoost is too smart for its own good. The best it could do was to essentially predict the most common song every time, which is what we have observed to be by far the most accurate approach thus far. \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we have reached an impasse with predictive modeling using the data we currently have. In absence of more details about users and songs, as well as with relatively few observations per user (only approximately 5-40 plays each), additional feature engineering would likely be a fruitless endeavor. As a final attempt, we will try a different recommendation approach: collaborative filtering. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will try to use all user's data to determine which songs are \"similar,\" and use that as a basis to recommend songs. We will take each user's last song and use these as our out-of-sample test songs. This differs from traditional regression-based classifier models where we used the standard train-test split methodology, because the former approach requires a set of X's for each observation to predict our Y (the song played), whereas this approach draws insights from all songs at once. Once we have excluded each user's last song, we will take the rest of the songs and determine their count of plays for each user using a crosstabulation. This will yield a vector for each song, where each number in the vector corresponds to a play count for that song for a different user. Then, we will use the measure of cosine similarity to give a \"closeness\" score to each pair of songs, indicating how similar their pattern of plays-by-user is. Then, for each song, we will find its closest song (excluding itself, for which its closeness will be perfect), and recommend this as the next song. "

    "### Recommendation Model Commentary\n",
    "\n",
    "After attempting a number of recommendation models, the collaborative filtering based on similar songs represents the best combination of accuracy and variety. Rather than using \"features\" of songs, we use their play counts by different users to represent different featuers. It predicts more than ten different songs, although predicts only two of them more than ten times. It also achieves an accuracy of around 7% on a small test sample of one song for each user, which is much better than a random guess of around 1%. It still falls short of the best prediction of simply picking the most popular song across the board, but that prediction mechanism is not realistic for reasons previously discussed.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of scaling a recommendation model to production, the similar song approach is also reasonable. It does not require any information about a new user to generate recommendations, instead relying on data about song plays that can be updated in an off-cycle batch process so recommendations can be generated instantaneously and updated intermittently. Furthermore, more information about the song - BPM, key, who wrote it, etc. - could help us improve our definition of \"similar\" songs beyond just comparing plays across different users. As well, as the variety of songs and users grow, variety should increase, rather than just a few of the most common songs being recommended every time. However, this is the case for all predictive models - they get better with more data. Additionally, it is easy to impose filters on recommendations - for example, the most similar song that the user has not played before, or that the user has not played in the last 24 hours, or is by a different artist, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more complex recommendation model could start from this baseline and use it as an input into recommending songs, while also considering factors like demography, user-generated ratings, etc. However, as a thought exercise, this recommendation model is a good place to start. Next steps could also include incorporating temporal elements into analysis - such as noticing that users listen to certain types of songs during specific times of day, or grouping user plays into \"sessions\" that take place together and weighing the input of these plays more strongly.

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "----How would you set up a test to check whether your model works well and is improving engagement?\n",
    "\n",
    "To test our model's efficacy, we want to perform some A/B testing. First, we will need to randomly segment our users into test and control groups - for example, by looking at a user's ID and splitting on odd/even numbers. Then, the test group will be receive recommendations from the model, while the control group will see no changes. After a period of time, compare various engagement metrics for the two groups - total plays, plays per day, listening session time, etc. Then, some simple statisical tests can determine whether there is a statistically significant difference in engagment across the two groups. From this, conclusions about the effect of the recommendation model can be drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, some features such as the ability to provide feedback such as taking surveys, rating recommendations, or turning on and off the recommendation feature will give some insight into how users perceive and use the new model."
