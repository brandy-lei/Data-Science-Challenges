# Data-Science-Challenges
Answers to challenges from "A Collection of Data Science Challenges"

This repository contains my Python notebooks to answer various problems in "A Collection of Data Science Challenges" by Giulio Palombo.
Data referenced by these files are presumably proprietary and therefore not included. 

I wanted to include these challenges to showcase how I think about and tackle various data science problems. I have only been writing code since I started graduate school in July of 2016, and I do not come from a computer science background. Rather, with an econ/statistics background and work experience in management consulting, and I think my code and problem solving approach reflect that. Take a look!
